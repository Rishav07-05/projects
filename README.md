## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each project resides in its own folder, containing all necessary files, including:

- Frontend and Backend code.
- Static assets such as images, fonts, and icons.
- Configurations for deployment or environment-specific setup.

The folder names reflect the project's purpose or feature focus, ensuring clarity and easy navigation.
